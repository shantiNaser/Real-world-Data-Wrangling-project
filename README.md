# Introduction
  Welcome to the Palestine Used Car Price Data Analyst Project! Our objective is to analyze changes in used car prices in Palestine from the end of 2020 to the beginning of 2021, using various features relevant to our   country.ðŸ“ˆ ðŸ“ŠðŸš—

# Our Project contains Two Data sets
> **Data 1 - Used Car Data and Prices in Palestine**
 > - Source: I manually updated the data that I collected during my graduation project from a different source. There are many features and rows available, but I have chosen to focus specifically on certain features and rows to align with the scope of this project.

> **Data 2 - USD to ILS Exchange Rates on Advertisement Dates.**
 > - Source: Scraped from Wise.com using BeautifulSoup (bs4).

# Conclusions
After conducting a thorough analysis of the data, examining the variables, and identifying correlations, the following insights were obtained:
* Key Factors Influencing Car Prices:
   * Analysis shows that car prices are primarily influenced by the production year and engine size.
* Impact of USD to NIS Exchange Rate on Car Prices:
   * The correlation between car prices and the USD to NIS exchange rate is minimal (0.053), suggesting that fluctuations in the exchange rate have little to no linear impact on car prices.
